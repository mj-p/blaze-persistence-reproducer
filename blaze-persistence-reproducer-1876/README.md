Blaze-Persistence Examples Spring Data WebMvc
==========
Reproducer for [#1876](https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/1876)

Query gets generated by faking the dbms dialect in `BlazePersistenceConfiguration`
with `config.registerDialect("h2", new PostgreSQLDbmsDialect());`

This will obviously throw an exception but should be enough to trace the bug.
Otherwise, one has to use a real postgres.

Generated SQL:
- Sub-Select's 3rd field: `toy3_.id`.
- Binding on `cat1_`'s id (3rd value)

```sql
SELECT cat1_.id AS col_0_0_,
       cat1_.name AS col_1_0_,
       NULL AS col_2_0_,
       person0_.id AS col_3_0_
FROM person person0_
INNER JOIN LATERAL
    (SELECT cat2_.age,
            cat2_.father_id,
            toy3_.id,
            cat2_.mother_id,
            cat2_.name,
            cat2_.owner_id
     FROM cat cat2_
     LEFT OUTER JOIN toy toy3_ ON cat2_.id=toy3_.cat_id
     WHERE cat2_.owner_id=person0_.id
     ORDER BY cat2_.age DESC NULLS LAST, cat2_.id DESC LIMIT 4)
     cat1_(age, father_id, id, mother_id, name, owner_id) ON (1=1)
WHERE person0_.id=?
```
